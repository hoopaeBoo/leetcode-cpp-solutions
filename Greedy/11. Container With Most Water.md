# **Container With Most Water**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the two vertical lines on a coordinate plane, which together with the x-axis, forms a container that can hold the maximum amount of water. The width of the container is the distance between the two lines, and the height is determined by the shorter of the two lines. The goal is to maximize the product of this width and height. We need an efficient approach to solve the problem due to potential high constraints on the size of the input.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
   - Use two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the height array.
   - Calculate the area formed by the lines at these two pointers and update a maximum area variable if the calculated area is greater than the previous maximum.
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line toward the other pointer. This is because the height of the container is limited by the shorter line, so moving it might lead to a larger area.
   - Repeat this until the two pointers meet.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of heights. Each height is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a few additional variables for pointers and max area.

            int width = right - left;
            maxArea = max(maxArea, currentHeight * width);
            
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;

### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `ContainerWithMostWater.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
