### **Task:**  
**LeetCode Problem Name:** Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  

**Problem Description:**  
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**  
- **Input:** `s = "abcabcbb"`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with a length of 3.

**Example 2:**  
- **Input:** `s = "bbbbb"`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The answer is "b", with a length of 1.

**Example 3:**  
- **Input:** `s = "pwwkew"`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with a length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**  
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

**Function Signature `required`:**  
```cpp
int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s);
```

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The main objective is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. A sliding window technique can be used effectively to scan through the string, keeping track of character positions to avoid duplicates within a moving window.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
- Utilize two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window of non-repeating characters.
- Use a hash map (`unordered_map`) to store the last appearance of each character.
- Expand the `right` pointer to iterate through the string.
- If a duplicate character is found, adjust the `left` pointer to be one position right of the last occurrence of that character.
- The `maxLength` is updated as the difference between the current indices of `right` and `left` pointers when the window is adjusted.
- Iterate till the end of the string to ensure the longest possible substring.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string, as each character is visited only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(m, n)), where `m` is the number of unique characters and `n` is the length of the string due to the hashmap storage.
