# **Longest Common Prefix**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings. A common prefix is a substring that appears at the start of each string in the array. If there is no common prefix, we need to return an empty string. The goal is to solve this problem efficiently, particularly considering edge cases, such as an empty input array or arrays that contain strings of varying lengths.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, the plan is as follows:
1. **Edge Cases**: First, we need to handle the special case where the input array is empty. If the array is empty, we should immediately return an empty string since there are no strings to form a common prefix.
2. **Sorting**: We can sort the strings lexicographically. The reason behind this is that the longest common prefix of the entire array will be the same as the longest common prefix of the first and the last string after sorting. This reduces the problem to comparing just two strings instead of all strings.
3. **Character Comparison**: Once we have the first and last strings, we can iterate through their characters until they differ. The common characters found before the difference will be the longest common prefix.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * log(n) + m), where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of the shortest string. The first term accounts for sorting the strings, and the second term accounts for the comparison of characters.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) in the sense that we are not using additional data structures that grow with the size of the input; however, the space complexity of sorting may also be considered based on the sorting algorithm.
